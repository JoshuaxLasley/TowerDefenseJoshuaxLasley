# TowerDefenseTemplate
 
#Reflections from the project: This progect in my opion was kind of hard and it was a lot of using new concepts of which I had never heard of before like, Path 2d follows, and HBox container.
#I added a tower which you can upgrade its attack defense or attack strength or radius. 
#Th solider moves around teh tile map and has 10 hp, if it gets to the ned you lose health.
#Overall Im'm happy with this project and how its turned out, yes I should've used more colorful assets but besides that it was overall good. 
#This project tested me heavliy and I learned a lot about GoDot.
